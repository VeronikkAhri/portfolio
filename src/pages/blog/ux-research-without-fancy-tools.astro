  <h2>Research Doesn't Need to Be Expensive</h2>
  <p>
    When I started at Google, I thought UX research meant fancy usability labs 
    and expensive analytics tools. But some of my best insights have come from 
    simply watching people use our products in their natural environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best research tool? Your eyes and genuine curiosity about people.
  </p>

  <h2>The Power of the 5-Minute Chat</h2>
  <p>
    I learned this from watching my Mexican abuela figure out her smartphone. 
    Five minutes of watching her struggle taught me more about interface design 
    than hours of A/B test data.
  </p>

  <h3>What to Watch For:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Where do their eyes go first?</li>
    <li>What do they click when confused?</li>
    <li>What words do they use to describe what they're trying to do?</li>
    <li>When do they give up?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Guerrilla Research Tactics</h2>
  <p>
    You don't need a research budget to understand users. Here's what actually works:
  </p>

  <h3>Coffee Shop Sessions</h3>
  <p>
    Bring your laptop to a coffee shop. Ask the person next to you to try your 
    interface for 2 minutes in exchange for buying their coffee. Most people say yes.
  </p>

  <h3>Screenshot Feedback</h3>
  <p>
    Share screenshots in Slack or Discord communities. Ask: "What would you click 
    first?" The answers will surprise you.
  </p>

  <h3>Family Testing</h3>
  <p>
    Your family members are perfect users – they have zero context and infinite 
    patience to tell you exactly what's confusing.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "If your mom can't figure out your interface in 30 seconds, neither can your users."
  </blockquote>

  <h2>The Questions That Actually Matter</h2>
  <p>
    Forget complex research methodologies. These three questions reveal everything:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>"What are you trying to do?"</strong> (Understanding intent)</li>
    <li><strong>"What's stopping you?"</strong> (Finding friction)</li>
    <li><strong>"How would you expect this to work?"</strong> (Mental models)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Digital Body Language</h2>
  <p>
    When you can't observe in person, analytics tell a story. But not the story 
    you think.
  </p>

  <h3>What Different Patterns Mean:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>High bounce rate:</strong> Expectations mismatch</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple form submissions:</strong> Unclear error states</li>
    <li><strong>Long time on page:</strong> Either very engaged OR very confused</li>
    <li><strong>Rapid clicking:</strong> Looking for something that should be obvious</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Kawaii Approach to Research</h2>
  <p>
    Make research feel fun, not formal. When people are relaxed, they give better 
    feedback. I often start sessions by sharing something silly about myself or 
    asking about their favorite anime (you'd be surprised how many Google engineers 
    are secretly weebs).
  </p>

  <h2>Tools I Actually Use</h2>
  <p>
    My research toolkit is embarrassingly simple:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Forms:</strong> For quick surveys</li>
    <li><strong>Loom:</strong> Screen recordings of user sessions</li>
    <li><strong>Figma comments:</strong> Async feedback on designs</li>
    <li><strong>Slack polls:</strong> Quick preference testing</li>
    <li><strong>My phone:</strong> Recording real conversations (with permission!)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When to Trust Your Gut</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes you know something is wrong before any research confirms it. Trust 
    that feeling, but validate it quickly. The fastest validation is often just 
    asking someone to try the thing while you watch.
  </p>

  <h2>Making Research a Habit</h2>
  <p>
    The best UX researchers I know don't do "research projects" – they just stay 
    curious about people all the time. They ask questions in elevators, notice 
    how people interact with signs, and pay attention to frustration patterns 
    in everyday life.
  </p>

  <h3>Weekly Research Ritual:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Monday: Pick one confusing part of your interface</li>
    <li>Wednesday: Ask 3 people about it (coworkers count!)</li>
    <li>Friday: Make one small improvement based on what you learned</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>The Real Secret</h2>
  <p>
    UX research isn't about proving you're right – it's about discovering you're 
    wrong as quickly and cheaply as possible. The sooner you can be wrong, the 
    sooner you can be right.
  </p>

  <p>
    And honestly? Being wrong is way more fun when you find out before your users do.
