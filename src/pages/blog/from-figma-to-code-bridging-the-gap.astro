  <h2>Why Designers and Developers Fight</h2>
  <p>
    I've been on both sides of this conversation. As a UX designer, I'd create 
    pixel-perfect mockups that seemed impossible to build. As a developer, I'd 
    receive designs that looked beautiful but ignored technical constraints.
  </p>

  <p>
    The gap isn't technical ‚Äì it's about understanding each other's superpowers 
    and limitations.
  </p>

  <h2>Design with Development in Mind</h2>
  <p>
    The best designs feel effortless to build because they work with technology, 
    not against it. This doesn't mean compromising on user experience ‚Äì it means 
    being smart about how you achieve it.
  </p>

  <h3>Constraints That Actually Help:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>8px grid system:</strong> Makes spacing consistent and developer-friendly</li>
    <li><strong>Component thinking:</strong> Design reusable pieces, not unique snowflakes</li>
    <li><strong>Real content:</strong> Design with actual text lengths and data volumes</li>
    <li><strong>Device constraints:</strong> Test on real phones, not just desktop</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Figma Organization That Developers Love</h2>
  <p>
    A messy Figma file creates messy code. Organize your designs like you'd 
    organize code: clear hierarchy, consistent naming, and logical grouping.
  </p>

  <h3>File Structure That Works:</h3>
  <pre><code>üìÅ Design System
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üé® Foundations (colors, typography, spacing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üß© Components (buttons, inputs, cards)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üì± Patterns (forms, navigation, layouts)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ Pages (actual product screens)

üìÅ Product Features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîê Authentication Flow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üë§ User Dashboard
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Pages</code></pre>

  <h2>Auto Layout = CSS Flexbox</h2>
  <p>
    Figma's Auto Layout works almost exactly like CSS Flexbox. Use it everywhere. 
    Your developers will thank you because your designs will translate directly 
    to responsive code.
  </p>

  <h3>Auto Layout Best Practices:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Set proper padding and gaps (use your 8px grid)</li>
    <li>Choose appropriate resize behaviors</li>
    <li>Use constraints for responsive behavior</li>
    <li>Name your auto layout frames descriptively</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    "If your Figma design doesn't use Auto Layout, your developer will have to 
    guess how it should behave when content changes. Guessing leads to bugs."
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Component Variants = Component Props</h2>
  <p>
    When you create component variants in Figma, think about how they'll become 
    props in code. Each variant property should map to a meaningful parameter.
  </p>

  <pre><code>// Figma Component: Button
// Property: "State" ‚Üí Values: "Default", "Hover", "Disabled"
// Property: "Size" ‚Üí Values: "Small", "Medium", "Large"
// Property: "Type" ‚Üí Values: "Primary", "Secondary", "Ghost"

// Code Component:
&lt;Button 
  state="default" 
  size="medium" 
  type="primary"
&gt;
  Click me
&lt;/Button&gt;</code></pre>

  <h2>Handoff That Actually Helps</h2>
  <p>
    Don't just throw designs over the wall. Create handoffs that answer the 
    questions developers will have before they ask them.
  </p>

  <h3>What to Include in Handoffs:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interactive states:</strong> hover, focus, active, disabled</li>
    <li><strong>Edge cases:</strong> long text, empty states, error states</li>
    <li><strong>Responsive behavior:</strong> how it looks on different screen sizes</li>
    <li><strong>Animation intentions:</strong> what should move and how</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility notes:</strong> focus order, screen reader labels</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Collaboration Techniques That Work</h2>

  <h3>Live Design Reviews</h3>
  <p>
    Share your screen while designing. Let developers see your thought process 
    and ask questions in real-time. Most "impossible" requests become simple 
    when developers understand the user need behind them.
  </p>

  <h3>Prototype Early and Often</h3>
  <p>
    Build low-fidelity prototypes in code, not just Figma. Sometimes the best 
    way to understand if an interaction works is to feel it in a real browser.
  </p>

  <h3>Pair Design Sessions</h3>
  <p>
    Sit with a developer and design together. They'll catch impossible layouts 
    early, and you'll learn what's easy vs. hard to implement.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Concepts Designers Should Know</h2>
  <p>
    You don't need to code, but understanding these concepts will make you a 
    better designer:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>CSS Box Model:</strong> margin, border, padding, content</li>
    <li><strong>Flexbox basics:</strong> justify-content, align-items, flex-direction</li>
    <li><strong>Responsive units:</strong> px vs. rem vs. em vs. %</li>
    <li><strong>Browser limitations:</strong> what causes performance issues</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility standards:</strong> WCAG guidelines and color contrast</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Developer-Friendly Design Decisions</h2>

  <h3>Choose Implementation-Friendly Patterns:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Consistent spacing (multiples of 8px)</li>
    <li>Limited font sizes (6-8 max)</li>
    <li>Semantic color naming (primary/secondary, not blue/green)</li>
    <li>Standard component states</li>
    <li>Progressive enhancement mindset</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When to Push Back (Nicely)</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes developers will ask you to compromise user experience for technical 
    convenience. When to hold your ground vs. when to find creative alternatives:
  </p>

  <h3>Hold Your Ground When:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>User research strongly supports the design</li>
    <li>Accessibility would be compromised</li>
    <li>The change would confuse users</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Find Alternatives When:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementation timeline is critical</li>
    <li>Technical complexity would create bugs</li>
    <li>There's a simpler solution that achieves the same goal</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tools for Better Collaboration</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Figma Dev Mode:</strong> Provides better specs and code snippets</li>
    <li><strong>Storybook:</strong> See your components in all their states</li>
    <li><strong>Browser dev tools:</strong> Inspect and tweak designs in real code</li>
    <li><strong>Loom:</strong> Record videos explaining complex interactions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Magic Happens in the Middle</h2>
  <p>
    The best digital products happen when designers understand technology and 
    developers understand users. You don't need to become an expert in the 
    other field, but curiosity about how the other side works will make you 
    infinitely more effective.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Google, our best features come from designer-developer pairs who genuinely 
    enjoy working together. They speak each other's language and share a common 
    goal: building something users will love.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember: we're all on the same team, trying to create something meaningful 
    for real people. The best bridge between design and code is empathy and 
    curiosity about each other's craft.
